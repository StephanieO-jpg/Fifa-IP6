# Fifa Analysis 

I have been provided with a FIFA dataset that is dated august 1993 to july 2018,and I will therefore create a result prediction model that will predict how many goals a home team and an away team scores. I used Machine Learning to make a Logistic regression model usig scikit-learn, pandas ,numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to create the prediction model.

# Goal

The goal is to create a prediction model that will be able to predict the outcome(win,loss or draw) of a match between 2 teams, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly
The learning outcomes here are feature modelling, data integration and finally the prediction of the outcome of each game.

# Data

I used two datasets the fifa ranking and results 

# Environment and tools

Google colab Notebook
Numpy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
